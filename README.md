# Image-Processing-Program-With-OpenCV
Image processing program OpenCV (C++)

About The Project

this project updated to do sum Image processing throw GUI built with MS Visual Studio run on x64 Windows machines 
Do some image operations like (rotating, flipping, zooming and custom rotate according to specific angel), 
Filtering using four techniques two for smoothing and two for sharpening which they are (median filter and average filter for smoothing) and 
(Prewitt differential Filter and Sobel Filter for sharpening), Point Processing techniques like 
(Brightness Adjustment, Image Blinding, Histogram Equalization, Log Transformation, Power Law Transformation and Negative Image), 
Smoothing and Sharpening techniques in frequency domain and (Image compression and Image segmentation are underdevelopment).
